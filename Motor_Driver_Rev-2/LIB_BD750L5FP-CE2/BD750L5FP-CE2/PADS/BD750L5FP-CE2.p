"Description" Ultra Low Quiescent Current LDO Regulator: The BD7xxL5FP-C Series are low quiescent regulators featuring 50V absolute maximum voltage, and output voltage accuracy of +/-2%, 500mA output current and 6A (Typ.) current consumption. There regulators are therefore ideal for applications requiring a direct connection to the battery and a low current consumption. Ceramic capacitors can be used for compensation of the output capacitor phase.
